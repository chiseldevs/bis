# Overview of Module

This module introduces students to the basic statistical concepts, critical reasoning, and understanding of the nature of data, which they may need to apply in the other courses they intend to study in their degree. The emphasis of the course is on the application of statistical methods to tackle real-world, data-rich problems in business and academia. Attention will focus on the calculation and interpretation of tables and results and the appropriate method to approach various aspects of real-world situations. Treatment is at an elementary mathematical level (basic calculus). Concepts of probability, statistical bias, randomness, random variables, statistical inference, basic data exploration and visualization techniques, data analytical methods, simple and multivariate analysis are introduced. Students become more time-efficient and enhance their analytical skills through hands-on experience with modern statistical tools.

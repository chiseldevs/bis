# Welcome BIS

We would like to inform you all that there is a CSF telegram group where you can join by following the link:
[**Telegram Group**](https://t.me/joinchat/BroIMhiOgEWVP8kZQagYZA)

As module leader said: "Please, join the telegram group as soon as possible in order to deal with any
arising problems!"

# Agenda

1. History of the computers
2. Brief history of computing software

# History of the computers

## Early history of computing

The story of computers starts with Abacus (around 2500 BC) - an early device to record numeric values.
It continues in the 17th century with Blaise Pascal and his mechanical device that could add, subtract, divide & multiply.
In the 18th century, Joseph Jacquard created his Loom machine that punched cards.
In th 19th one, Charles Babbage created his analytical engine.

## Generation of computers

**As it's known that computers' generation is divided into 4 parts:**

- First generation computers (1951 – 1959)
- Second generation computers (1959-1965)
- Third Generation computers(1965-1971)
- Fourth Generation computers(1965-1971)
- Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence (Present and Beyond)

### First Generation of Computers (1951 – 1959)

- Vacuum tubes stored information
- Generated a lot of heat
- Primary memory device – magnetic drum that rotated under read/write head
- Slow Input/Output
  - Input device – card reader that read the holes punched in an IBM card
  - Output – punched card or a line printer
- Use: UNIVAC was the first commercial computer
  delivered to a business client, the U.S. Census Bureau
  in 1951.

### Second Generation of Computers (1959-1965)

- Transistor replaced vacuum tubes
- Smaller, more reliable
- Memory made from magnetic cores, tiny doughnut-shaped devices, each capable of storing one bit of information -> Immediate access memory
- Transistors and other components - were assembled by hand on printed circuit board
- Use: atomic energy industry

### Third Generation of Computers (1965-1971)

- Integrated Circuits (IC) - solid pieces of silicon with transistors, other components, and their connections.
- Smaller, cheaper, faster, and more reliable
- 1970s – several thousand transistors on a silicon chip
- Memory – use of transistor, each transistor one bit of information, volatile memory – the information went away when the power was turned off
- Input, output device – the terminal with keyboard and screen first appeared
- Use: Computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience because they were smaller and cheaper than their predecessors

### Fourth Generation of Computers (1965-1971..present?)

- Large scale integration
- Micro-computer on a chip
- Development of GUIs, the mouse and handheld devices.
- The workstations were networked
- PC (Personal Computer) entered the vocabulary
  - Apple
  - Tandy/Radio Shack
  - Atari
  - Commodore
  - Sun
  - IBM
  - Hewlett-Packard and many others
- Use: desktop computers in many areas of life as more and
  more everyday products began to use microprocessors

### Fifth Generation of Computers (Present and Beyond) [Artifical Intelligence]

Fifth generation computing devices, based on **artificial intelligence**, are still in
development, though there are some applications, such as **voice recognition**,
that are being used today.

The use of **parallel processing** and **superconductors** is helping to make artificial
intelligence a reality.

**Quantum computation** and **molecular** and **nanotechnology** will radically
change the face of computers in years to come.

**Use:** The goal of fifth-generation computing is to develop devices that respond to
natural language input and are capable of **learning and self-organization**.

# Brief history of computing software

## First Generation Software

- First programs were written on machine language
- Instructions were built into the electrical circuitry of a particular computer
- E.g.: small task of adding two numbers together used three instructions
  written in binary (1s and 0s), and the programmer had to remember which
  combination of binary digits means what
- Programming in machine language is both time-consuming and prone to
  errors -> first artificial programming languages were developed - assembly
  languages, used mnemonic codes to represent each machine-language
  instruction.

## Second Generation Software

- More powerful hardware → more powerful tools to use it effectively
- Assembly language limitation (thinking in terms of machine instructions) →
  more powerful languages (high level) developed - Fortran, Cobol, Lisp
- Same program could now run on more than 1 computer
  - Compiler – translating program
- Systems programmers wrote tools like assemblers and compilers
- Application programmers used these tools to write programs
- The application programmer was becoming even more insulated from the
  computer hardware

## Third Generation Software

- With 3rd generation of computers, it became clear that the human was
  slowing down the computing process.
- Computers were sitting idle while waiting for the computer operator to
  prepare the next job.
- Solution: put the computer resources under the control of the computer => to
  write a program that would determine which programs were run when => an
  operating system

## Fourth Generation Software

- Structured programming, a logical, disciplined approach to programming
  - Pascal
  - Modula-2
  - BASIC
  - C
  - C++
- More powerful operating systems
  - UNIX under AT&T
  - PC-DOS for IBM PC
  - MS-DOS
  - OS for Macintosh with mouse and point-and-click graphical interface
- Application software packages appeared
  - Spreadsheets
  - Word processors
  - Database management systems

## Fifth Generation Software

- Microsoft
- Apple
- Open source software (Linux and alike)
- Object-oriented design and programming
- World Wide Web
- Embedded systems

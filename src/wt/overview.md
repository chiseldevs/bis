# A little tour to Web Technology Course

## Intro

The module provides a theoretical introduction with Internet infrastructure and services as well as a practical introduction to concepts and terminology used in the design and implementation of web-based information systems, i.e. study of fundamental technologies of the web - including HTML5, CSS3 (markup languages), Javascript (programming language) and base technologies for building a minimum viable web application from scratch and managing its deployment process.

**Module leader:** Bunyod Khoshimkhujaev

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the module, the successful student will be able to:

1. Apply modern web technologies for processing, identifying, and presenting information on the static web pages.
2. Demonstrate technical skills required for web developers through the use of relevant technologies - HTML, CSS, and corresponding technologies for improving development flow - pre-processors, template engines, development environments, etc.
3. Design basic accessible, responsive, and user-friendly user interfaces based on the best practices and standards used worldwide.
4. Illustrate how client-server architecture can be applied to build full-fledged dynamic web applications.
5. Explain how to define routes and logic/controllers to handle user requests to the web application.
6. Develop basic web application from scratch as well as using modern web frameworks. Assess how frameworks can simplify the development process.
7. Deploy web applications using both hand-coding and appropriate software tools to the live server. Perform basic server configuration for properly serving user requests.

## Course outcomes the module contributes to

- L4.2. Identify the various activities involved in translating a given problem into a corresponding executable program; Produce syntactically correct programs/websites for business needs.
- L4.4. Communicate results in an appropriate format with regard to audience and desired effect using computer applications as appropriate
- L4.5. Identify and use tools involved in the development of Information Systems.

## Indicative syllabus content

- Internet infrastructure and environment.
- Website planning. Goals and objectives. Design and construction strategies. Maintenance and monitoring. Navigation and site structures. Management of design and construction process. Semantic web.
- An overview of HTML5, website construction, and publishing tools. Styling and layout concepts (CSS3)
- Responsive and adaptive web pages. Using third-party CSS libraries.
- Interactive components. Writing scripts on JavaScript, embedding third-party Javascript libraries.
- HTTP protocol. Routing and controllers for handling client requests.
- Template engines. The templated extension (reusability of the templates) and data interpolation, etc.
- REST API.
- Development and deployment of the full-fledged web application. Hosting and domain name management.

## Teaching and learning methods

The module will consist of seminars (2 hours a week). The theoretical part of the seminars will introduce key concepts of web development while the practical part will focus on basic product development. Exercises will be set and solved by the tutor first and after some practice, students will be provided with independent work exercises.

## Assessment rationale

The module will be assessed by means of two coursework. The coursework will enable students to use their understanding of web application planning, designing based on the usability and accessibility principles/standards to create a rigorous and carefully developed piece of work.

**Coursework 1** - This will be an individual assignment. Students will be given a case study (various topics -i.e. Bookstore, Social network, Ticket booking application) and will be required to develop a front-end of the web application using modern web technologies and design principles. Coursework 1 covers LO1, LO2, LO3.

**Coursework 2** - This will be an individual assignment. Students will be given case studies and will be required to develop a backend for the web application using the indicated web framework. Coursework 2 covers LO4, LO5, LO6, LO7.

## Assessment criteria

Students are going to be assessed on the following criteria:

A pass level would represent the ability to demonstrate a basic understanding of the subject. To achieve a pass mark, students should be able to:

apply standard web technologies (HTML, CSS) to structure web pages and style its elements.
apply front-end scripting language (Javascript) to manipulate DOM elements or make them interactive, fetch data from the Internet and properly display them on the web pages.
explain how the high-level web protocols work, and how APIs, Web Services, & RESTful architectures are built to move data around.
apply back-end scripting language (Javascript) to build the basic application (business logic) layer of the web application and integrate it with front-end.

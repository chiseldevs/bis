## Starting to code

:::warning
Before starting to code. there are a few things that you should keep in mind!
:::

HTML is HyperText markup language and HyperText means that it uses the HTTP part of the Internet, Markup means the code you write is annotated with keywords, Language means it can be read by both a human and a computer

Standardized so well that it works similar in all the browsers. HTML is used by browser to build webpage.

The latest version of HTML is HTML5. It's transferable over HTTPS because it is just text.

:::tip
Building blocks of HTML are elements a.k.a ‘tags’
:::

### Biology of HTML element

```html
<p>Some useless text</p>
```

**For example:**
This type of elements don’t need closing pair element thus called self-closed

```html
<img src=”./avatar.jpg” alt=”” />
```

HTML element attributes

```html
<a href="#">Read more</a>
```

You will focus their efforts on identifying factors that influence organizational effectiveness and integrating aspects of managerial activities.

Our module will consist of lectures, seminars, and demonstrations/guest lectures by practitioners. Lectures will introduce key concepts and theories and give examples from industry. Seminars will be interactive involving class discussion, case analysis, reflective learning and presentations regarding the topics what you have learned during the lecture in the previous week. Demonstrations (extracurricular) will vary depending on the invited speaker and his expertise; they can be case study based demonstrations or reflective lectures of their practice.

# Rules

Netiquette at WIUT
Please observe proper Netiquette -- courteous and appropriate forms of communication and interaction over the Internet (within your online modules).
This means:

- no personal attacks,
- no obscene language,
- no intolerant expression. All viewpoints should be respected.
- no downloading and redistributing of videos and other materials developed by your lecturers among other people and in public or personal domains.
  Some tips:
- Be respectful of other view points and opinions. Remember, all people are different, and you are responding to a personâ€™s idea, not criticizing a personality or way of thinking.
- Think before responding to your peers to avoid misunderstandings.
- DO NOT USE ALL CAPS, which can be considered impolite and aggressive. You probably thought that you were yelled at when you started reading the previous sentence; therefore, avoid this.
- Spell out acronyms because people may not know what they mean.
- Do not use obscene language and slang. Use standard, grammatically correct English.
